# Hyperthymesia - Product Description for Website/Marketing

## What is Hyperthymesia?

Hyperthymesia is a **local-first, privacy-focused universal AI search and knowledge assistant** that helps you understand, search, and navigate all your digital data using intelligent AI.

**Today:** Focus on code. Developers search and understand their codebases.
**Tomorrow:** Everything. Search photos, emails, documents, files, notes, and more - all locally, all privately.

Unlike cloud-based tools, everything runs on your machine. Your data never leaves your computer.

## Our Vision

**"Give humans a perfect memory - a personal AI that knows everything about them, respects their privacy, and helps them understand their entire digital world."**

We're building the OS for your digital life. Starting with code, expanding to everything. Hyperthymesia will be your always-on personal AI that understands:
- How your software works
- What you've learned (your notes, documents)
- Your memories (photos, messages)
- Your thoughts and creative work
- Your decisions and experiences
- Your relationships and communications

All locally. All privately. All intelligent.

---

## Core Problem We're Solving (Today)

Developers spend countless hours:
- Searching through large codebases trying to find how things work
- Understanding complex code patterns and architecture
- Onboarding to new projects (learning unfamiliar codebases)
- Answering questions like "How does authentication work?" or "Where is error handling implemented?"

Current solutions require:
- Uploading code to the cloud (privacy concerns)
- Expensive APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, etc.)
- Internet connection
- Dealing with rate limits and quotas

**But this is just the beginning.** Tomorrow's problem is even bigger:

People are drowning in digital data:
- Thousands of photos but can't find the one you need
- Years of emails but can't find context
- Notes scattered everywhere, never integrated
- Documents that contain knowledge you've already discovered but forgotten
- No system connects everything you know

Cloud search (Google Photos, Gmail, etc.) knows more about you than you know about yourself - and keeps it on their servers.

## The Solution: Hyperthymesia

Hyperthymesia combines:
1. **Hybrid Search** - Both keyword and semantic search to find relevant code
2. **AI Agent** - Intelligent multi-tool orchestration for complex queries
3. **Local LLMs** - Private inference on your machine (no cloud)
4. **RAG Enhancement** - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for detailed explanations

### Key Differentiators

✓ **100% Private** - Code never leaves your machine
✓ **No Subscription** - One-time setup, no recurring costs
✓ **Works Offline** - No internet required after setup
✓ **Fast** - Local processing vs. API calls
✓ **Multi-Backend** - Ollama, llama-cpp, MLX on Apple Silicon or local model of your choice

## How It Works

### Simple Queries
```
Search: "authentication"
→ Direct keyword + semantic search
→ Returns relevant files instantly
```

### Complex Questions
```
Agent Query: "How does authentication work?"

Steps:
1. Agent analyzes query complexity
2. LLM generates reasoning about what to do
3. Creates multi-step action plan
4. Executes tools:
   - SearchTool: finds auth-related code
   - AnalyzeTool: understands structure
   - SynthesizeTool: creates overview
5. RAG Enhancement: generates detailed explanation with code context
6. Returns: Quick answer + detailed explanation + sources
```

## User Journey

### Onboarding
1. Install via Homebrew: `brew install hyperthymesia`
2. Index codebase: `hyperthymesia index add /path/to/project`
3. Start querying: `hyperthymesia agent "your question"`

### Daily Use
- Search for code: `hyperthymesia search "keyword"`
- Ask complex questions: `hyperthymesia agent "how does X work?"`
- Understand patterns: `hyperthymesia agent "explain the retry mechanism"`
- Explore architecture: `hyperthymesia agent "what is the authentication flow?" --verbose`

## The Long-Term Evolution: From Code Search to Universal Personal AI

### Why Start With Code?

Developers are the perfect first market because:
1. **Clear problem** - Finding code in large codebases is genuinely hard
2. **High value** - Saves hours per week for every developer
3. **Technical audience** - Will push us to build the right foundation
4. **Expansion path** - Same technology applies everywhere

### The Architecture That Scales Beyond Code

What we're building for code works for everything:

**For Code:** Hybrid search + semantic understanding + context-aware answers
**For Photos:** Visual search + metadata search + context-aware grouping
**For Email:** Natural language search + sentiment analysis + thread understanding
**For Notes:** Knowledge graph building + relationship discovery + serendipitous connections
**For Everything:** Universal AI that understands your entire digital life

### How It Evolves

**Year 1 (Code Excellence):** Master code search, become the best code understanding tool
**Year 2 (Expansion):** Add photos, email, documents using same architecture
**Year 3+ (Integration):** Connect everything into a unified personal knowledge system

### Why This Matters to Investors/Users

This is not just a code search tool. It's the foundation for something far bigger:

- **Defensible moat** - Once you have all someone's data indexed locally, network effects are huge
- **Recurring usage** - Personal OS you use daily across all work
- **Expandable TAM** - Start with 25M developers → 5B people with digital lives
- **Privacy-first advantage** - As data privacy becomes critical, we win
- **Next-gen interaction** - Voice search, visual search, conversational queries across all data

### The "Hyperthymesia" Name

Named after the rare condition of having a perfect memory. That's what we're building - a personal perfect memory system that:
- Never forgets your data
- Always finds what you ask for
- Connects disparate pieces into understanding
- Shows you patterns in your own life
- Helps you learn from your own history

- Developers index their codebase
- They ask complex questions like "How does authentication work?"
- Hyperthymesia uses hybrid search + an intelligent agent + local LLMs to provide detailed answers
- Everything runs locally (100% private, no cloud)
- Installs via Homebrew in < 10 minutes

**Key Features:**
1. Hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
2. Agentic mode (multi-tool orchestration)
3. RAG enhancement (detailed explanations)
4. Multi-backend LLM support (Ollama, llama-cpp, MLX)
5. Works offline, no subscriptions

**Target Users:**
- Developers exploring codebases
- New team members onboarding
- Maintainers of legacy code
- Open source contributors
- Solo devs switching projects

**Why It Matters:**
- Privacy (code stays local)
- Cost (free, no API bills)
- Speed (no network latency)
- Control (no vendor lock-in)
